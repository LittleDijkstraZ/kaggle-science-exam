The Open Book method was first presented by JJ (@jjinho) [here][1], then Quangteo (@quangbk) improved RAM usage [here][2], and Anil (@nlztrk) combined with Q&A [here][3]. Radek (@radek1) demonstrated the strength of Q&A [here][5]. Next Mgoksu (@mgoksu) demonstrated how to achieve top public LB=0.807 using this method [here][4] by finetuning DeBerta large on this method.\n","\n","In order to train a model for use with Open Book Q&A, we need a CSV that contains; `prompt` (i.e. question), `A, B, C, D, E` (i.e. answer choices), and we need a column of `context` extracted from wikipedia pages for each question. To generate the `context` column, we run Mgoksu's notebook [here][4]. In code cell #5, we load our CSV without `context` column with code `trn = pd.read_csv(OUR_DATASET.CSV)`. Then in code cell #21 our dataset is saved to disk as `test_context.csv` with the column `context` added.\n","\n","I have searched and concatenated all publicly shared datasets into one 60k CSV and then ran Mgoksu's notebook with `NUM_TITLES_INCLUDE = 5` and `NUM_SENTENCES_INCLUDE = 20`. This added an additional `context` column. I uploaded the resultant CSV file to a Kaggle dataset [here][6]. If you enjoy the notebook you are reading, please upvote the dataset too.

She also entertained the troops with her former screen partner, Gene Autry. ===Later career=== After World War II, McKenzie retired from films to raise her two children. She was briefly billed as Fay Shannon. ==Biography== ===Early life and silent film=== McKenzie was born on February 19, 1918, in Hollywood, California, to show business parents, film actor Eva (née Heazlitt) and Irish American actor/director Robert McKenzie.Mike Fitzgerald, \"An Interview with... She starred in silent films as a child, and then sound films as an adult, but perhaps she is best known for her leading roles opposite Gene Autry in the early 1940s in five horse opera features. Fay's sister Ida Mae McKenzie, cousin Ella McKenzie, and brother-in-law Billy Gilbert, were also actors. McKenzie sang duets with Autry in each of these films. Ida Mae also played the character of Sarah Lincoln in The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln, in the part of the film where she had become a teenager. ===Schooling=== In the mid-1920s, McKenzie took a ten-year break from acting in order to focus on her education. Her father had a stock company called the McKenzie Merry Makers, and was both an actor and director in stage productions and films. McKenzie later recalled, ===Sound films=== McKenzie appeared in numerous uncredited roles throughout the 1930s, with occasional credited roles in films such as The Boss Cowboy (1934) as Sally Nolan, and the anti-cannabis propaganda film Assassin of Youth (1937) as Linda Clayton. She later remembered: ===Theater and touring=== During World War II, McKenzie left Republic Pictures to work in theater and pursue other projects. McKenzie went on to appear in four additional Autry films as his leading lady: Sierra Sue (1941) as Sue Larrabee, Cowboy Serenade (1942) as Stephanie Lock, Heart of the Rio Grande (1942) as Alice Bennett, and Home in Wyomin' (1942) as Clementine Benson.
