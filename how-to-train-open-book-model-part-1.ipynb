The Open Book method was first presented by JJ (@jjinho) [here][1], then Quangteo (@quangbk) improved RAM usage [here][2], and Anil (@nlztrk) combined with Q&A [here][3]. Radek (@radek1) demonstrated the strength of Q&A [here][5]. Next Mgoksu (@mgoksu) demonstrated how to achieve top public LB=0.807 using this method [here][4] by finetuning DeBerta large on this method.\n","\n","In order to train a model for use with Open Book Q&A, we need a CSV that contains; `prompt` (i.e. question), `A, B, C, D, E` (i.e. answer choices), and we need a column of `context` extracted from wikipedia pages for each question. To generate the `context` column, we run Mgoksu's notebook [here][4]. In code cell #5, we load our CSV without `context` column with code `trn = pd.read_csv(OUR_DATASET.CSV)`. Then in code cell #21 our dataset is saved to disk as `test_context.csv` with the column `context` added.\n","\n","I have searched and concatenated all publicly shared datasets into one 60k CSV and then ran Mgoksu's notebook with `NUM_TITLES_INCLUDE = 5` and `NUM_SENTENCES_INCLUDE = 20`. This added an additional `context` column. I uploaded the resultant CSV file to a Kaggle dataset [here][6]. If you enjoy the notebook you are reading, please upvote the dataset too.

If we run this notebook on Kaggle, then we need to use tricks to train models efficiently. Here are some ideas:\n","* use fp16 (this speeds up T4 not P100)\n","* use gradient_accumlation_steps (this simulates larger batch sizes)\n","* use gradient_checkpointing (this uses disk to save RAM)\n","* use 2xT4 instead of 1xP100 (this doubles GPUs)\n","* freeze model embeddings (this reduces weights to train)\n","* freeze some model layers (this reduces weights to train)\n","* use PEFT (this reduces weights to train)\n","* increase LR and decrease epochs (this reduces work)\n","* use smaller models (this reduces weights to train)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b5b0b0ad","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.319810Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.319497Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.464301Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.463316Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.163369,"end_time":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.467069","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.303700","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"b5b0b0ad"},"outputs":[],"source":["training_args = TrainingArguments(\n","    warmup_ratio=0.1,\n","    learning_rate=2e-5,\n","    per_device_train_batch_size=1,\n","    per_device_eval_batch_size=2,\n","    num_train_epochs=2,\n","    report_to='none',\n","    output_dir = f'./checkpoints_{VER}',\n","    overwrite_output_dir=True,\n","    fp16=True,\n","    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,\n","    logging_steps=25,\n","    evaluation_strategy='steps',\n","    eval_steps=25,\n","    save_strategy=\"steps\",\n","    save_steps=25,\n","    load_best_model_at_end=False,\n","    metric_for_best_model='map@3',\n","    lr_scheduler_type='cosine',\n","    weight_decay=0.01,\n","    save_total_limit=2,\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d71abaf7","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.498666Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.498003Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-02T03:07:53.061465Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-02T03:07:53.060407Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1406.581582,"end_time":"2023-09-02T03:07:53.063898","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-09-02T02:44:26.482316","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"d71abaf7","outputId":"ebcfde07-909b-4fa4-b75d-192fdb0bd682"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["You're using a DebertaV2TokenizerFast tokenizer.
