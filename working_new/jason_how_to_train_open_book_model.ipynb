        "# How To Train Model for Open Book Q&A Technique\n",
        "In this notebook we demonstrate how to train a model to be used with top scoring Open Book Q&A method. The Open Book method was first presented by JJ (@jjinho) [here][1], then Quangteo (@quangbk) improved RAM usage [here][2], and Anil (@nlztrk) combined with Q&A [here][3]. Radek (@radek1) demonstrated the strength of Q&A [here][5]. Next Mgoksu (@mgoksu) demonstrated how to achieve top public LB=0.807 using this method [here][4] by finetuning DeBerta large on this method.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to train a model for use with Open Book Q&A, we need a CSV that contains; `prompt` (i.e. question), `A, B, C, D, E` (i.e. answer choices), and we need a column of `context` extracted from wikipedia pages for each question. To generate the `context` column, we run Mgoksu's notebook [here][4]. In code cell #5, we load our CSV without `context` column with code `trn = pd.read_csv(OUR_DATASET.CSV)`. Then in code cell #21 our dataset is saved to disk as `test_context.csv` with the column `context` added.\n",
        "\n",
        "I have searched and concatenated all publicly shared datasets into one 60k CSV and then ran Mgoksu's notebook with `NUM_TITLES_INCLUDE = 5` and `NUM_SENTENCES_INCLUDE = 20`. This added an additional `context` column. I uploaded the resultant CSV file to a Kaggle dataset [here][6]. If you enjoy the notebook you are reading, please upvote the dataset too. Thanks!\n",
