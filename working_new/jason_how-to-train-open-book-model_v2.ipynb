The Open Book method was first presented by JJ (@jjinho) [here][1], then Quangteo (@quangbk) improved RAM usage [here][2], and Anil (@nlztrk) combined with Q&A [here][3]. Radek (@radek1) demonstrated the strength of Q&A [here][5]. Next Mgoksu (@mgoksu) demonstrated how to achieve top public LB=0.807 using this method [here][4] by finetuning DeBerta large on this method.\n","\n","In order to train a model for use with Open Book Q&A, we need a CSV that contains; `prompt` (i.e. question), `A, B, C, D, E` (i.e. answer choices), and we need a column of `context` extracted from wikipedia pages for each question. To generate the `context` column, we run Mgoksu's notebook [here][4]. In code cell #5, we load our CSV without `context` column with code `trn = pd.read_csv(OUR_DATASET.CSV)`. Then in code cell #21 our dataset is saved to disk as `test_context.csv` with the column `context` added.\n","\n","I have searched and concatenated all publicly shared datasets into one 60k CSV and then ran Mgoksu's notebook with `NUM_TITLES_INCLUDE = 5` and `NUM_SENTENCES_INCLUDE = 20`. This added an additional `context` column. I uploaded the resultant CSV file to a Kaggle dataset [here][6]. If you enjoy the notebook you are reading, please upvote the dataset too. Thanks! \n","\n","![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/format:webp/1*bTGY3fKIgNefQxNsOYpnBw.png)\n"," \n","(image source [here][7])\n","\n","[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jjinho/open-book-llm-science-exam\n","[2]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/quangbk/open-book-llm-science-exam-reduced-ram-usage\n","[3]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/nlztrk/openbook-debertav3-large-baseline-single-model\n","[4]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/mgoksu/0-807-sharing-my-trained-with-context-model\n","[5]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/radek1/new-dataset-deberta-v3-large-training\n","[6]: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdeotte/60k-data-with-context-v2\n","[7]: https://blog.gopenai.com/enrich-llms-with-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-17b82a96b6f0"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Load CSV\n","We will load 60k CSV of `prompts`, `A,B,C,D,E`, and `context` from my Kaggle dataset [here][1].
